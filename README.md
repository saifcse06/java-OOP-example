# OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)
It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some OOPs Concepts in Java:

    Object
    Class
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation

# What are Objects?
    Objects are always called instances of a class which are created from a class in java or any other language. They have states and behaviour.
# What are Classes?
    Classes are like object constructors for creating objects. The collection of objects is said to be a class.
# What is Inheritance?
    Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. Inheritance also supports hierarchical classification.
There are five types of inheritance 
1. Single
2. Multilevel
3. Multiple
4. Hybrid and 
5. Hierarchical

# What is Polymorphism?
    Polymorphism refers to many forms, or it is a process that performs a single action in different ways. It occurs when we have many classes related to each other by inheritance. 
Polymorphism in java can be classified into two types:

1. Static / Compile-Time Polymorphism
2. Dynamic / Runtime Polymorphism
# What is Abstraction?
    Abstraction is a process which displays only the information needed and hides the unnecessary information. We can say that the main purpose of abstraction is data hiding.
# What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the concepts in OOPs concepts; it is the process that binds together the data and code into a single unit and keeps both from being safe from outside interference and misuse.
